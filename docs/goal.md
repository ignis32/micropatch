# Microrack Patchbook: Project Goal & Requirements

**Goal:**  
To create a web-based patchbook for Microrack modular synths, enabling users to visually build, save, and share synth patches using virtual breadboards and modules.

**Key Requirements:**
- Users can drag and drop modules onto one or more virtual breadboards.
- Modules can be positioned, configured, and interconnected with virtual patch cables.
- Multiple breadboards are supported in a single patch.
- Each module exposes inputs, outputs, knobs, and switchable modes, as defined in its metadata.
- Module library, metadata, and panel images are loaded from a local directory structure generated by a parser.
- Users can adjust knob values and mode switches directly in the UI.
- Users can save, load, and export/import patch files (JSON).
- Users can add free-form notes to a patch.
- UI is responsive and suitable for desktop and tablet use.
- (Optionally) Gallery for sharing and browsing patches.
